# gohard

### Description

gohard (golang harden) is a partial rewrite of [grapheneX](https://github.com/grapheneX/grapheneX), which I also try to actively maintain.
The goal was to get rid of all third party libs, and only have a CLI app.

I started learning Golang recently, so I thought this would be a good practice.
